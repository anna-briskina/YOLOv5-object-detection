# Object Detection Using YOLOv5
This project implements an object detection model in Google Colab.

The primary aim is to detect and classify objects within images and videos, utilizing the COCO dataset, which contains 80 object classes such as people, cars, and animals. The project leverages a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to achieve efficient and accurate real-time detection.

This project demonstrates the practical applications of object detection technology, with potential uses in areas like autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and medical imaging. It showcases the effectiveness of YOLOv5 for object detection, offering opportunities for further development, such as fine-tuning on custom datasets or enhancing model performance with larger YOLOv5 variants.

The output video features real-time object detection with bounding boxes and labels indicating various objects, primarily cars and pedestrians, and confidence scores for each detected object, demonstrating the model's robust performance in identifying objects in a dynamic urban environment.
